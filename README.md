Pokemon Explorer is an interactive web application that allows you to dive into the fascinating world of Pokémon using a free, open-source API. Powered by the official [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/), this project dynamically retrieves Pokémon data and presents it with a sleek, modern, and responsive design built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap 5.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** Enjoy a seamless experience on any device, whether you're on desktop, tablet, or mobile.
- **Technology Badges:** Display the official badges for HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and Bootstrap.
- **Pokémon Filtering:** Easily filter Pokémon by various criteria (e.g., type, or show all) to find your favorites.
- **Pagination:** Efficiently navigate through multiple pages of Pokémon data.
- **Dynamic Modal:** Click on any Pokémon card to launch a modal window that reveals detailed information, including:
  - Name
  - Primary Type
  - Abilities
  - Base Stats
  - Height and Weight
  - Sprite Image
  - Additional notable details

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This project runs directly in any modern web browser without any additional dependencies. For development purposes, using a code editor with live preview capabilities (such as Visual Studio Code with the Live Server extension) is highly recommended.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
git clone https://github.com/bocaletto-luca/Pokemon-Database.git cd pokemon-explorer

2. **Launch the Application**

- Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
- Alternatively, use a live-reload server from your code editor to view changes in real time.

## How It Works

- **Data Fetching:** The application uses the Fetch API to retrieve Pokémon data from the [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/), processing the JSON response to dynamically generate cards for each Pokémon.
- **Filtering & Pagination:** Users can filter Pokémon based on certain criteria and navigate through the pages of results using a simple, intuitive pagination system.
- **Dynamic Modal Display:** Clicking on a Pokémon card opens a modal window that provides an in-depth look at the Pokémon's attributes and statistics.
